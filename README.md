Demographic Data Analysis and Visualization
This project involves analyzing a dataset of demographic details for various countries. The analysis focuses on key indicators such as birth rates, income groups, and internet usage. Tasks include calculating statistical measures, filtering data by specific criteria, and creating a pivot table to summarize insights.

Dataset
The dataset contains demographic information, including:

Country
a.Birth Rate
b. Income Group
c. Internet Users

Analysis Tasks

1. Create Named Ranges
Set up named ranges for Birth Rate and Income Group to make calculations and references more efficient.

2. Statistical Calculations
Mean: Calculate the average birth rate and internet users.
Median: Find the median values for birth rate and internet users.
Variance: Calculate both population and sample variances for birth rate and internet users.
Standard Deviation: Find both population and sample standard deviations for birth rate and internet users.
Interquartile Range (IQR): Determine the IQR to understand the central spread of birth rate and internet users.

3. Filtering by Country and Income Group
Filter to identify the income group for India.
Filter countries in the same income group as India and calculate the total count of these countries.
Pivot Table Creation

4. Create a pivot table that includes Country, Income Group, and Internet Users. This table provides a summarized view of internet usage by country and income group.

Results
The analysis provides insights into:
The central tendency and variability of birth rates and internet usage.
Demographic groupings based on birth rates and income levels.
Patterns of internet usage across different income groups.
